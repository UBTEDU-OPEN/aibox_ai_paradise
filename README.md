# AI box AI paradise


## Introduce:

This is a demo on Aibox to showcase its AI capabilities. Once installed, users can experience some of Aibox's AI capabilities by running the corresponding demos. These are just some simple examples, and users can achieve different combinations of capabilities through their own programming.

To simplify installation and deployment, we have written a setup script called install.sh, which can be executed directly for installation. (Note that this application is specifically for AI box and should not be executed on other device.)


## Quick Start

1. cd setup 
2. sudo ./install.sh
