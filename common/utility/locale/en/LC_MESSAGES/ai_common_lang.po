msgid "ubt_loading_tip8"
msgstr "Common frameworks for deep learning include PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, and so on. For novices, Keras may be the best choice because the API it encapsulates is more abstract and advanced."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip9"
msgstr "The recurrent neural network (RNN) is a kind of neural network model used to process sequence data. It is frequently applied to the field of natural language processing and is also used for all kinds of time series prediction."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip11"
msgstr "Transfer learning is a method of machine learning, which means that a pre-trained model is reused in another task, enabling you to accelerate modeling of the second task or improve its performance."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip15"
msgstr "In Python 3.x, “/” (division) is used. Different from Python 2. X, the results of its division between integers are floating point numbers. For example, the result of 5/3 is 1.66666666667."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip16"
msgstr "The implementation of many modern neural networks is based on GPU, which was originally a special hardware component developed for graphics applications. Therefore, the neural network benefits from the development of the game industry."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip17"
msgstr "CPU is like a college student. It can fix a surface integral problem in 10 minutes, but can't finish 1000 hundred digit addition problems in 10 minutes. GPU is like 100 primary school students, who can complete 1000 hundred digit addition problems in 10 minutes."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip18"
msgstr "The conventional face recognition process is as follows: face detection - face alignment - facial features extraction - facial features comparison."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip19"
msgstr "The task of image classification is to judge whether the object in the image is object A. The target detection task means that we should not only use the algorithm to judge whether there is object A in the image, but also find out its position in the picture, that is, its bounding box."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip20"
msgstr "The task of semantic segmentation is to segment an image into area blocks with certain semantic meaning using fixed methods, recognize the semantic category of each area block, achieve the semantic reasoning process from the bottom to the top, and finally get a segmented image with pixel-by-pixel semantic annotation."

msgstr "Currently semantic segmentation has been applied to the fields such as geographic information system, unmanned driving, medical image analysis, and robot."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip22"
msgstr "The difference between over fitting and under fitting is that under fitting shows poor performance in both the training set and test set, while over fitting can often better learn the properties of training set data, but shows poor performance in the test set."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip23"
msgstr "Turing test means that the computer answers a series of questions raised by a human tester within 5 minutes. If more than 30% of its answers enable the tester to mistakenly believe that they are answered by human beings, the computer passes the test."

msgid "ubt_loading_tip29"
msgstr "The main reasons that deep learning rose again in 2010 are as follows: 1. The improvement of hardware, especially the development of GPU, greatly accelerated the matrix operation; 2. Large-scale data sets emerged; 3. The training algorithm was improved."
